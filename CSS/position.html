<h1>Positioning</h1>
<div>
(1) By default, block of text just follow each other
</div>
<div>
(2) one after another
</div>
<div style="position: relative; left: -20px; top: 20px;">
(3) A relative position moves a block away from where it would normally lay out.
</div>
<div>
(4) And text after that just lays out. So be somewhat careful with relative.
</div>
<div style="border-color: green;position: fixed;left: 30%;bottom: 20px;">
(5) Fixed text is relative to the <em>window</em>.
it maintains its position even when the window is resized or scrolled
</div>
<div style="border-color: orange;position: absolute;top: 40px;left: 30%;">
(6) Absolute text is relative to its parent element.
In this case the <strong>div</strong> is positioned
relative to the <strong>body</strong> tag.
It maintains its position even when the window is resized or scrolled.
</div>
<div>
(7)In a sense, the <strong>fixed</strong> and <strong>absolute</strong>
elements are "plucked out"
of the normal render stream and as such
take up no vertical space.
there is not any padding or margin
left behind by these tags.
</div>
<div style="border-color: yellow;position: relative; left: -1000px">
(8) Where did the text go?
</div>
<div style="border-color: yellow;">
(9) why can't I see (8) bit it took up space?
</div>
